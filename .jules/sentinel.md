## 2024-05-18 - Prevent Sensitive Error Data Leakage
**Vulnerability:** Raw error objects from FFmpeg and browser APIs (`error.message` and `console.error`) were being rendered directly in the user interface and browser console.
**Learning:** Returning unhandled exception messages to the client risks exposing internal stack traces, system paths, and unexpected framework vulnerabilities to potential attackers.
**Prevention:** Catch error blocks should log a sanitized version of the error or omit sensitive details, while the state presented to the user should be a generic, friendly, and secure fallback message (e.g. "Processing failed securely").
